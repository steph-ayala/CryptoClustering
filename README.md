# CryptoClustering

This project explores the effect of 24-hour 7-day, and so on leading up to 1 year price changes on cryptocurrency prices using unsupervised learning techniques in Python. The goal is to uncover hidden patterns or trends in the price fluctuations of cryptocurrencies without using labeled data.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and standardized cryptocurrency price data.
Unsupervised Learning: Applied clustering (K-Means) and dimensionality reduction (PCA) to identify patterns.
Visualization: Used hvplot to visualize clusters and relationships in the data.

Installed the required dependencies:
Pandas
hvplot
KMeans
PCA
StandardScaler

Unsupervised learning revealed clusters of cryptocurrencies with similar price movement behaviors. The analysis showed that 24-hour changes are more influential in short-term fluctuations, while 7-day changes are better for mid-term trend analysis.
